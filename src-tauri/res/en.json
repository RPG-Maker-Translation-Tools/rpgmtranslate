The folder to open MUST contain the data or original folder with the original game files. If the folder does not contain the parsed text of the game in the translation folder, the program will automatically parse it. By default, the program supports reading and writing RPG Maker MV/MZ engine files, i.e. files in the format .json. In order for the program to read and write RPG Maker XP/VX/VXAce engine files (.rxdata, .rvdata and .rvdata2), you need to install Ruby, and then install rvpacker-txt using gem install rvpacker-txt. The program regularly creates backups of translation files along the path \"project_folder/backups\", the backup period and the maximum number of backups can be adjusted in the settings. By default, the program creates backups every 60 seconds.<br>When saving a translation in the program, all translation files will be saved in the path \"project_folder/translation\".To save the changes in the project, just click save or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl +S. The program will automatically save your project, and when you run the program again, you can pick up where you left off.<br>To compile your translation into the original files (by default .json and .rxdata, .rvdata and .rvdata2 if you have Ruby and rvpacker-txt installed) games, just click the compile button or use the Alt+C keyboard shortcut. Be sure to save the translation before compiling. The program will create fully functional files in the folder \"project_folder/output\".<br>You can read this manual again or get help about the program's hotkeys by selecting the \"About\" and \"Hotkeys\" items in the top menu, respectively."
