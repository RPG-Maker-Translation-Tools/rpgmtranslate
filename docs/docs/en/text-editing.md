## Editing Area Layout

In the screenshot, editing area marked under number 5.

As you can see, it contains row column, which tracks the row number of the row, and provides `Delete` and `Bookmark` buttons.

Then goes the source text column, which, obviously, contains the source text. You can copy the source text from each row by clicking on it with left mouse button.

Then the translation text column follows. There can be unlimited number of translation columns, and you can change the name of each.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

You can edit the translation textarea like any other website input field. Available shortcuts:

- Ctrl + ArrowDown - Move to next row (down)
- Ctrl + ArrowUp - Move to previous row (up)
- Ctrl + ArrowLeft - Move to the left translation column
- Ctrl + ArrowRight - Move to the right translation column
- Ctrl + T - Machine translation:
    - First activation: Show translated text
    - Second activation: Apply translation
- Left-click on source text - Copy the source text

Note: The program currently only supports Google Translate.

## Batch Select

You can select multiple translation textareas by selecting one, and holding shift while selecting the other.

You can batch copy/cut/paste multiple translation textareas.

## Batch Text Processing

Access it through the "Tools" button.
