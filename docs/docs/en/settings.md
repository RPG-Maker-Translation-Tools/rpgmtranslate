# Settings

For now, settings include not that much options, but let's walk over them.

## Backup

You can enable or disable backup, set backup interval and maximum number of backups.

## Display line breaks in text areas

When this option in selected, it will display the line breaks in text areas. I don't remember why I implemented this, probably to not be confused when text row is so long, that it exceeds the textarea's width.

## Check for updates

You can disable checking for updates not to bother you, but believe me, each new update **will** make the program better.

## Row delete mode

By default, to not mess everything up you can't delete the row using the button using the X button.
You can configure that here.

## Translation languages

That's for machine translation. Right now it's global, but still, you can set the "from" and "to" languages for machine translation.

## Font

Font selection is available, although it won't affect all the interface, only text in the textareas and settings themselves.

Someday there'll be a separate font selector for UI font, but it'll bring compatibility issues, so that's for later.
